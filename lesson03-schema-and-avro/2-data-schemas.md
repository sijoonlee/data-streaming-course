## What are Data Schemas?
- Data schemas help us define:
    - The shape of the data
    - The names of fields
    - The expected types of values
- Whether certain data fields are optional or required.
- Data schemas provide expectations for applications so that they can properly ingest or produce data that match that specification
- Data schemas are used for communication between software
- Data schemas can help us create more efficient representations with compression
- Data schemas help systems develop independently of each other
- Data schemas are critical in data systems and applications today
