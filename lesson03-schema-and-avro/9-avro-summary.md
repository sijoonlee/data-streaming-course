## Apache Avro - Summary
In this section you learned how to use Apache Avro as a Data Schema:

- Avro has primitive types, such as int, string, and float
- Avro has complex types, such as record, map, and array
- Avro data is sent alongside the schema definition, so that downstream consumers can make use of it
- Avro is used widely in data engineering and the Kafka ecosystem
