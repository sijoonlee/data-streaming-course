### Querying in KSQL

Ad-hoc querying in KSQL is one of the tools greatest strengths. Lets have a look at some sample
queries.

### Basic filtering

We've already seen how to filter data in the table creation process, but lets revisit it one more
time

```
SELECT uri, number
  FROM clickevents
  WHERE number > 100
    AND uri LIKE 'http://www.k%';
```

### Scalar Functions

KSQL Provides a number of [Scalar functions for us to make use of](https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/syntax-reference.html#scalar-functions).

Lets write a function that takes advantage of some of these features:

```
SELECT UCASE(SUBSTRING(uri, 12))
  FROM clickevents
  WHERE number > 100
    AND uri LIKE 'http://www.k%';
```

This query will strip the `http://www.` from the start of the URI and capitalize it.

The `SUBSTRING` function takes a string and which character to start at (and optionally end at)
The `UCASE` function takes a string and capitalizes it.

### Terminating Queries

**`SELECT` queries are not persistent!**

Notice that as soon as you hit `CTRL+C` your query ends. When you run the query again, KSQL has to
recreate the query. This means that if you want the results of this query to be persistent, you
need to create a Table or a Stream.
