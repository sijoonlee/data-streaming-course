## Querying Syntax
- SELECT statements may be run in KSQL CLI, but as soon as the session is terminated, so too is the data calculation.
- Use CREATE STREAM <stream_name> AS SELECT… and CREATE TABLE <table_name> AS SELECT … to persist your queries for long-term usage

- [See the KSQL documentation for a list of all Scalar functions supported for querying](https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/syntax-reference.html#scalar-functions)
