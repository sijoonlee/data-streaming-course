## Using REST Proxy - Summary
REST Proxy is a powerful tool for integration applications into Kafka that could not otherwise use it.

REST Proxy offers a comprehensive API for producing and consuming data from Kafka topics, and even provides fine-grained control over consumer groups, offsets, and partitions.

## Keep REST Proxy in Mind!
Throughout this section you’ve seen how you can easily leverage the HTTP API of REST Proxy to integrate applications directly into your Kafka ecosystem. While the HTTP API may not be as nice as a native Kafka client, it still provides a fairly straightforward path for integration.

As Kafka grows within your organization, you will likely find applications that can’t integrate with Kafka for one reason or another. When that happens, look to REST Proxy!
