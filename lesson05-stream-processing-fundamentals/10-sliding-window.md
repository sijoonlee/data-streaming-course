## Sliding Window
- Similar to Hopping Window, except the increment is not directly configurable and updates in real-time
- A sliding window of the last 12 hours always includes all of the last 12 hours of data. Data is expired as soon as it reaches the 12-hour threshold, and new data is added as soon as it is received.
- Sliding Windows have **no gaps** between windows
- Sliding Windows **do overlap**
