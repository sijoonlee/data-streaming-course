##  Filtering Streams
- Filtering a stream is the process of removing unwanted or unneeded data from an input stream, and outputting the desired data into a new stream
- Filtering may be a step in joining or combining two or more streams
- Filtering is often desirable when data clients donâ€™t need access to all data for throughput or security reasons
- Applying filters earlier, rather than later, in the processing pipeline, can allow stream processing calculations to scale better and analyze less data
