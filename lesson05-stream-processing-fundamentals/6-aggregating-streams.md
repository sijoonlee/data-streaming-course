## Aggregating Streams
- An aggregation involves taking two or more distinct events and creating one or more new events based on a transformation function
- Aggregate Functions: Max, Min, Sum, TopN, HIstograms, Sets, Lists, and more
- Aggregates in streaming applications almost always involve a timeframe, unless the source topic is compacted
