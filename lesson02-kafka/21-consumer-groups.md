## Consumer Groups
- group is is required
- Consumer groups are clients consuming from the same topic
- Kafka uses the consumer group id to assign partitions to specific consumers within the consumer group
    - a partition can send messages to only one consumer at a time
    - one consumer can get messages from mulitiple partitions
    - if there is only one partition in topic, only one consumer will do the job even when there are several other consumers in the group
- rebalancing
    - Consumer groups increase fault tolerance and resiliency by automatically redistributing partition assignments if one or more members of the consumer group fail.
    - consumer group leader will reassign partitions to the other consumers in the group
    - consuming process will halt when rebalancing
