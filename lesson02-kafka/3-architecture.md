## Kafka Architecture
- Kafka servers are referred to as brokers  
- All of the brokers that work together are referred to as a cluster
- Clusters may consist of just one broker, or thousands of brokers  
- Apache Zookeeper is used by Kafka brokers to determine which broker is the leader of a given partition and topic  
- Zookeeper keeps track of which brokers are part of the Kafka cluster
- Zookeeper stores configuration for topics and permissions (Access Control Lists - ACLs)  
- ACLs are Permissions associated with an object. In Kafka, this typically refers to a userâ€™s permissions with respect to production and consumption, and/or the topics themselves.  
- Kafka nodes may gracefully join and leave the cluster  
- Kafka runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Kafka Clustering - Key Points
Kafka servers are referred to as brokers and organized into clusters.
Kafka uses Apache Zookeeper to keep track of topic and ACL configuration, as well as determine leadership and cluster management.
- Usage of ZooKeeper means that Kafka brokers can typically seamlessly join and leave clusters, allowing Kafka to grow easily as its usage increases or decreases.
