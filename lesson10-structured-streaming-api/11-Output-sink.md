## What are Sinks?
Spark Structured Streaming uses sinks to add the output of each batch to a destination.

## Currently these are the following types of sinks supported:
- File sinks
- Kafka sinks
- Foreach and foreachBatch sinks
- Memory sinks
- Console sinks

## Modes for Using Built-in Output Sinks
There are a few modes for writing to output sinks:
- Append - Only new rows are written to the output sink.
- Complete - All the rows are written to the output sink. This mode is used with aggregations.
- Update - Similar to complete, but only the updated rows will be written to the output sink.
