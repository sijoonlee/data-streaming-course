## Action and Transformation Functions in RDDs and DataFrames
There are two types of Apache Spark RDD operations - transformations and actions. Transformations produce a new RDD from an existing RDD. Actions trigger evaluation of expressions and send data back to the driver.

Transformations build an RDD lineage. For example, this code rdd.map().filter().join().repartition() builds a lineage of map -> filter -> join -> repartition. You can see this lineage through the .explain operation or through the Spark UI.

The resulting RDD from a transformation is always different from its parent RDD. It can be smaller or bigger or the same size (e.g. map).

Transformations also have two types of operations - narrow and wide. Narrow is map-like, and wide is reduce-like.

When the action is triggered, the computation is sent back to the driver. You may persist an RDD in memory using the persist method if there are many transformations and actions applied, so that Spark keeps the RDD around the cluster for faster access the next time.
